Tennis Score Kata
==================

Taken from: http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataTennis

Goal
-----

The basic principle to calculate a tennis score. Easy.

To keep it simple, the tennis match only lasts for one game.

The game is turn based. Player one goes first, then player two.
Repeat until there is a winner.

At any time, you can check the score, it should be after a point has
been assigned.

When there is a winner, they should be declared and the game terminated.

Tests should be written first!

----------

* Less than 10 people, no more than 5.
* A laptop.

* A room far away from where people are trying to work quietly.
* Beer.

* At the end of the 5 minutes, one of the pair moves off to be replaced
  by an onlooker.

Use no flow control, such as 'if' or the ternary operator.
