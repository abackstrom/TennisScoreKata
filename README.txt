The basic principle to calculate a tennis score. Easy.

The game is turn based. Player one goes first, then player two repeat
until there is a winner.

At any time, you can check the score, it should be after a point has
been assigned.

When there is a winner, an exception should be thrown, declaring a
given player the winner and the champion of the world.

Tests should be written first!
